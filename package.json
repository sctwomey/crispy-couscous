  "description": "This challenge requires the development of a command-line application that generates a simple logo for projects. When the user is prompted for text, the user can enter up to three characters for the logo. When the user is prompted for text color, a color keyword (or hexadecimal number) can be entered. When the user is prompted for a logo shape, the user is presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square. When the user is prompted for the color of the shape, a color keyword (or hexadecimal number) can be entered by the user. Once the information is entered for the complete logo, an SVG file is created that is named 'logo.svg'. The output text \"Generated logo.svg\" is printed in the command line to let the user know that the logo has been generated. The user can then open the 'logo.svg' file in a browser, and the logo is displayed as a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria that the user was prompted to enter.",
